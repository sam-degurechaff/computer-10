	<h2>input divice</h2><img src="input.jpg" width="250"><a name="input"></a>
		<p>In computing, an input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mouse, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones.</p>

	<a name="output"></a>
	<h2>output divice </h2><img src="output.jpg" width="250">
		<p>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment converting information into human readable form. It can be in form of text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video. Some of the output devices are Visual Display Units like a Monitor, Printer graphic Output devices, Plotters, Speakers</p>

	<a name="cpu"></a>
	<h2>cpu</h2><img src="cpu.jpg" width="250">
		<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by the instructions given by the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units</p>

	<a name="alu"></a>
	<h2>arithmetic logic unit</h2><img src="alu.jpg" width="250">
		<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit</p>

	<a name="cu"></a>
	<h2>control unit</h2><img src="control.jpg" width="250">
		<p>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.</p>

	<a name="rcm"></a>
	<h2>rondom-access memory</h2><img src="random.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

	<a name="om"></a>
	<h2>optical memory</h2><img src="optical.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>Optical storage is any storage type in which data is written and read with a laser. Typically, data is written to optical media, such as compact discs (CDs) and DVDs.</p>

	<a name="mcm"></a>
	<h2><h2>mangnetic-core memory</h2><img src="magnetic.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years between about 1955 and 1975. Such memory is often just called core memory, or, informally, core. ... Magnetic hysteresis allows each of the cores to "remember", or store a state. Each core stores one bit of information.</p>

	
	<a name="fm"></a>
	<h2>flash memory</h2><img src="flash.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>Flash memory, also known as flash storage, is a type of nonvolatile memory that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. Flash memory is widely used for storage and data transfer in consumer devices, enterprise systems and industrial applications.</p>

	<a name="lg"></a>
	<h2>logic gates</h2><img src="logic.jpg" width="250">
		<p>Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. It is an electronic circuit having one or more than one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic. Based on this, logic gates are named as AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate etc.</p>
